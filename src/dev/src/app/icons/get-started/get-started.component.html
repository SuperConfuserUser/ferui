<h2>Getting started with FerUI Icons</h2>

<p>
  The Ferui Icons library presents pixel-perfect, scalable SVG-based icons. This new icon system gives you complete control over
  icon color, orientation, and size. Additionally, you can access and customize any SVG graphic elements inside the icon through
  standard CSS.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-primary fit-content">
  The Ferui icons library extends the amazing
  <a href="https://vmware.github.io/clarity/icons/clarity-icons" target="_blank">Clarity Icons</a> library. We only added more
  shapes to the library and we load only the Clarity <span class="text-danger">core</span> icon set by default.
</p>

<h4>Install and load Ferui Icons:</h4>

<p>Install the Ferui Icons package through npm:</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="'npm install @ferui/icons --save'"></code></pre>

<p>Install the polyfill for Custom Elements, on which Ferui Icons is dependent:</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="'npm install @webcomponents/custom-elements@1.0.0 --save'"></code></pre>

<p>
  Load the library in your app by including <span class="text-danger">ferui-icons.min.css</span> and
  <span class="text-danger">ferui-icons.min.js</span>. Also, make sure to include
  <span class="text-danger">custom-elements.min.js</span>, the Custom Elements polyfill before
  <span class="text-danger">ferui-icons.min.js</span>:
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="codeExample1"></code></pre>
<p>
  That's it! As <span class="text-danger">ferui-icons.min.js</span> loads not only the Clarity Icons Api, but also all icons sets
  (including Ferui ones), you will have access to more than 100 different icons that have variants, orientations, and colors out
  of the box. You can now render any icon with <span class="text-danger">clr-icon</span> tag and specify your desired
  <span class="text-danger">shape</span> in its shape attribute.
</p>

<h4>Load icon sets individually:</h4>

<p>
  If you want to use icons from few individual sets, you don't have to load all icons with
  <span class="text-danger">ferui-icons.min.js</span>. Instead, load the lighter version of Ferui Icons library with
  <span class="text-danger">ferui-icons-lite.min.js</span>, which loads only Clarity Icons Api and Core Shapes set. For example,
  if you want to use icons from only Social Shapes and Travel Shapes, you would load Clarity Icons this way:
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="codeExample2"></code></pre>

<h4>Load Clarity Icons API and icon sets in Typescript:</h4>
<p>It's easy to load Clarity Icons API and icon sets in Typescript.</p>

<p class="alert alert-primary fit-content">
  If you load the Clarity Icons in Typescript, make sure you are not loading it through the script tag again. Otherwise you will
  have two different instances of Clarity Icons that override one another.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="'import \'@clr/icons\''"></code></pre>
<p>
  The example above is loading only Clarity Icons Api and Core Shapes set. You can load more icon sets on top of it as needed:
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="codeExample3"></code></pre>
<p>
  And lastly, if you need to use shapes from all sets, you don't need to import and load every single icon set, because you have a
  shortcut for loading all sets:
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="codeExample4"></code></pre>

<h4>Optimize Clarity Icons in your application</h4>

<p>
  You can import each icon shapes as individual modules and add them to the Clarity Icons API. Leveraging this new method of
  importing icons with Tree-shaking process, you can make a significant optimization to the size of Clarity Icons in your
  application. For example, if you need to use car, pin, and star icons in an application, you can import and add them in the
  following way:
</p>
<pre><code [highlight]="codeExample5"></code></pre>
<p>
  You can see that each shape modules have "ClrShape" prefix in the example above. An important thing to note here is that, to
  take advantage of this new method, you should only load Clarity Icons by importing it from "@clr/icons" and make sure that you
  are not loading it via a script tag or in some other manner.
