<h2>Getting started with FerUI Design</h2>

<p>
  The Ferui Design library is based on
  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a> CSS framework. We've
  extended the framework and addapt it to fit our needs. Some of the basic/default Bootstrap configurations are not exactly the
  same as the original framework. <br />
  Please use our documentation instead to know about the changes.
